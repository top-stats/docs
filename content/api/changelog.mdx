    ## New API Ratelimits

    </ChangelogTitle>
    <ChangelogItemDescription>

    We’ve deployed a fix to our API ratelimits. Previously, ratelimits were entirely global, which limited usage to **60 requests per minute** across all routes combined. This behavior has now been corrected.

    </ChangelogItemDescription>

    <ChangelogItemTitle>New Ratelimit Structure</ChangelogItemTitle>

    - **Per-route ratelimit**: 60 requests per minute
    - **Global ratelimit**: 120 requests per minute

    <Callout title="Important Notice" type="warn">
      Excessively exceeding either the per-route ratelimit or the global ratelimit will result in a ban.
    </Callout>


    <ChangelogItemTitle>Additional Information</ChangelogItemTitle>

    - Shard-related values (for example rankings or graph data) can no longer be fetched via the API.
    - These fields may still appear in the bot schema, but they will now always return 0.

    ## API Changes and Upcoming Deprecations

    </ChangelogTitle>
    <ChangelogItemDescription>

    Top.gg has announced changes to their API, which affect some of the data displayed on our site. As a result, the following fields are now deprecated and will be removed in the coming weeks.

    </ChangelogItemDescription>
    <ChangelogItemTitle>Deprecated Response Fields</ChangelogItemTitle>
    The following fields are deprecated and will be removed once the Top.gg update is fully released:

    - `defAvatar`
    - `certifiedBot`
    - `lib`
    - `shard_count`
    - `shard_count_rank`

    <ChangelogItemTitle>Impact</ChangelogItemTitle>

    The removal of `shard_count` has a **significant impact on one of the major statistics** we currently track on our site. We are aware of this and will publish a separate announcement soon with more details on how this affects statistics going forward.
