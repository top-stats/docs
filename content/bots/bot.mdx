#### Tooltips
Hovering over the graphs, you can see the exact data points, their dates and values. The value in brackets, indicates the growth or loss compared to the previous data point. So for example if would show the growth from the previous hour.

    As a supporter, one of the features you will get, is the ability to directly compare the previous time period's data
    directly within the graph itself. Up to a year. For example if you select the 1 month timeframe, you will be able to
    see the same value for the month before within the tooltip!
