### Using our Graphs

#### Tooltips
Hovering over the graphs, you can see the exact data points, their dates and values. The value in brackets, indicates the growth or loss compared to the previous data point. So for example if would show the growth from the previous hour.


<Tabs items={['Free', 'Premium']}>
  <Tab value="Free">

  <Tab value="Premium">

    As a supporter, one of the features you will get, is the ability to directly compare the previous time period's data
    directly within the graph itself. Up to a year. For example if you select the 1 month timeframe, you will be able to
    see the same value for the month before within the tooltip!

#### Average Growth Percentage
  The **average growth** represents the mean percentage change over a selected time range.  
  It is calculated by averaging the growth percentages of each individual time period.

  ![avg-growth.png](/bots/avg-growth.png)

<Callout>
  The average growth is calculated using the following formula:

  ```math
  Average Growth = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} g_i
  ```

  - $g_i$ = Growth rate of the $i$-th time period (e.g. day, week, or month) in percent
  - $n$ = Total number of time periods included in the calculation

  <Accordions type="single">
    <Accordion title="Example">
      Suppose you select a **1-week period** and measure the growth for each day:

      - Day 1: **+10%**  
      - Day 2: **+5%**  
      - Day 3: **+2%**

      The average growth is calculated as:

      ```math
      \text{Average Growth} = \frac{10 + 5 + 2}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67\%
      ```

      This means that, on average, the value increased by **approximately 5.67% per day** over the selected period.
