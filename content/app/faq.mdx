  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    id='interaction-failed'
    title='Slash Commands Respond With "This Interaction Failed"'
  >
    If you get a "This Interaction Failed" error when using slash commands, try
    updating Discord. If that does not work, make sure that TopStats is online
    and that there is not currently an outage. If none of this works, reach out
    to our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/x48WXcTFVD).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion id='slash-command-failed' title='Slash Commands Wont Work'>
    If slash commands are not appearing in your server, try the following:
    1. Make sure they are enabled. Go to the [Install the App](./invite/index.mdx) page to learn more.
    2. Make sure you have the `Use Application Commands` permission in role and channel settings.
    3. Try [re-inviting the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=583807014896140293)
    4. Make sure your Discord is up-to-date.
    If you have tried all of these and are still having issues, reach out to us in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/x48WXcTFVD).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion id='deauthorize-app' title='TopStats slash commands are still showing after I removed the bot from my server.'>
    If you are still seeing TopStats commands while typing `/`, most likely you have added TopStats into your profile. Go to your **Discord settings** > **Authorized Apps** and **deauthorize** TopStats from there.
