<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<UsersIcon className='text-white' />}
    href='./install/server'
    title='Add to Server'
  >
    If you own or manage a server, you might want to add the app directly to it.
    This allows you to use the full feature set of TopStats to enhance your
    server.
  </Card>
  <Card
    icon={<UserIcon className='text-white' />}
    href='./install/app'

# Invite troubleshooting

<Accordions type='single'>
  <Accordion title="I can't find my server. What's the reason?">
    The main reason for your server not appearing in the drop-down menu is the
    use of the wrong account. Make sure you're logged into the right account
    which you can check on the top of the invite screen. You should see your
    profile picture and Discord tag. If it's the wrong account, press the **Not
    you?** button.
    
    Also note that you must have **Manage Server** or **Administrator**
    permissions on a server in order to add the bot. Servers where you don’t
    have these permissions won’t show up in the list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Discord asks me to verify my e-mail address.'>
    If you like to add a bot to a server you require an account with a verified
    e-mail. Head over to your user settings and verify your e-mail.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I got through inviting the bot, but I can't find it on my server">
    If this happens, the bot likely lacks permissions to see in the channel
    you're in. To check this, you can search in the member list in server
    settings for TopStats. If the bot is not in there, try re-inviting the bot.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
